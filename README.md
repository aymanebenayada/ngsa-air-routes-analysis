# ngsa-air-routes-analysis

This folder contains the code and data used for *Studying the robustness of air routes networks*. 

The code is in Python 3. The main packages required are: 
- `networkx`
- `Basemap`

## code 

- `PyGeoTools`: useful [library](https://github.com/jfein/PyGeoTools) for dealing with locations expressed in terms of latitude and longitude. The code has been adapted to Python 3
- `spatial_hazards.py`: class used for simulating a spatial hazard against an air traffic network
- `utils.py`: bunch of useful functions used throughout the projet
- `air_traffic_networks.ipynb`: notebook that guides through the main results of our study

## data
